# FIBA 3x3 Bosnia Event Scraper

A Python script to scrape FIBA 3x3 basketball events for Bosnia and Herzegovina, store them in a database, and send email notifications when events change.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your email credentials:
